Path Tracing with GPU Acceleration using CUDA

This project was developed as a part of CSCI 580 - 3D Graphics & Rendering at USC.

This branch is completely inspired by Roger Allen.

My hardware specs are - 
1. Gencode flags - computer architecture 30
2. Graphics coprocessor - NVIDIA GTX 1050
3. 16GB RAM

Following Peter Shirley's books on 'Raytracing in one weekend' (https://raytracing.github.io), the time taken on my system to build the 500 random samples was 50 mins, which reduced drastically to 3.9 mins using CUDA.

The whole code has been run on visual studio 2017.

The further branches contain the Cornell box output inspired by Peter Shirley and Roger Allen.
