Path Tracing with GPU Acceleration using CUDA

This project was developed as a part of CSCI 580 - 3D Graphics & Rendering at USC.

This branch is completely inspired by Roger Allen and Peter Shirley (as mentioned in the master branch).

My hardware specs are - 
1. Gencode flags - computer architecture 30
2. Graphics coprocessor - NVIDIA GTX 1050
3. 16GB RAM

There are 5 scenes in the code and they are rendered on visual studio 2017.

This branch contains the Cornell box output with GPU acceleration.

My Results -
Original code took 80 mins to render the cornell box (100 samples/pixel)
This code takes 5 mins to render the cornell box (100 samples/pixel)
